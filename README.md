# ERAU_REU_Project_Code
In this repository you will find all of the code that we used in our research on preforming quantitative and qualitative analysis on Principal Component Analysis and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization. You will also find our paper and poster.

If there exists a function inside a file, I created a main so all you would need to do is run that file. I recommend using ipython to run all files since everything was tested using it. However, it should work when executing it normally without ipython.

To make things easy, I included duplicate data.py and dataset.mat files in the PCA and NNMF folder. I have a file where I plot the dataset that we have and that file is included in the PCA folder.
