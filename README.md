# ERAU_REU_Project_Code
This is all of the code that was created to aid our team in our efforts to preform quantitative and qualitative analysis on Principal Component Analysis and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization.

If there exists a function inside a file, I created a main so all you would need to do is run that file. I recommend using I-Python to inspect variables if you are more interested in understanding how to use PCA and NNMF on a dataset that you have.

To make things easy, I included duplicate data.py and dataset.mat files in the PCA and NNMF folder. I have a file where I plot the dataset that we have and that file is included in the PCA folder.
